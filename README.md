## Project Description
The Dialogflow V2 Unity Plugin is a continuation from [Api.ai: Unity Plugin](https://github.com/dialogflow/dialogflow-unity-client), which made it easy to integrate the Dialogflow(Api.ai) natural language processing API into your Unity project.

## Team Members
- [Ilana Pecis Bonder](https://github.com/ilanabonder)
- [Alice Sun](https://github.com/alicehgsun)
- [Lin Zhang](https://github.com/linzhangcs)

## Define the problem
- Api.ai: Unity Plugin is no longer working in Dialogflow V2, due to the difference in the way the basic system works ([Dialogflow API v2 versus v1](https://miningbusinessdata.com/dialogflow-api-v2-versus-v1/)).
- Dialogflow API V1 will be shut down in one year – on [October 23rd, 2019](https://plus.google.com/+dialogflow/posts/M6EUgZFhckL).
- Our goal will be figuring out ways to build similar plugin that works in Dialogflow V2 system.

## Address Greater Landscape
Opening new possibilities to involve voice-based conversational interaction in VR and AR environment.

## Deliverables
- Feature: listening and sending voice data from Unity to the Dialogflow V2 service for recognition and processing
- Doc: show and explain how to use it (including STT process, if required)

## Timeline
This project will be completed over 5 weeks (Nov 6 - Dec 11). Describe a timeline in detail below.

### Week 1
- Defining project schedule and make proposal [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mL3yOky0exaPJceU6yWSf6stgKd8rLB1gd0UZUrA8hg/edit?usp=sharing)
- Reaching out mentors
- Meeting with Nicole @1PM, Nov 8
- Dialogflow V2 Unity Plugin Hackathon Nov 11

### Week 2
- Analyzing the authentication process in Dialogflow V2
  - [Authentication via Google Cloud Service Account JSON key](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/v2-auth-setup)
  - ~~It will give 401 error without adding the generated “client_email” in JSON file into the Dialogflow project authentication panel:~~

<table><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

  - ~~Adding the “client_email” to "INVITE NEW PEOPLE" will give access to the Dialogflow project:~~

<table><tr><td>
<img src="docs/images/auth-access.png"/ alt="Successful access to Dialogflow project">
</td></tr></table>

- [JSON Web Token (JWT)](http://leoncvlt.com/blog/json-web-token-jwt-for-google-cloud-platform-in-unity/) for Google Clout Platform in Unity
- How can we automate this process?

### Week 3
- [Audio Request Support](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/api-v2/rest/v2/projects.agent.sessions/detectIntent#QueryInput): Passing audio file directly via V2 API call

<table><tr><td>
<img src="docs/images/audio-support.png"/ alt="Audio request support from Dialogflow">
</td></tr></table>

- Using [Audio Source](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioSource.html) in Unity to [capture audio from a microphone](https://github.com/alicehgsun/dialogflow-unity-v2/blob/master/microphoneCapture.cs)

<table><tr><td>
<img src="docs/images/audio-source.png"/ alt="Audio Source in Unity">
</td></tr></table>


### Week 4
- Testing with a text call "hello", which received fulfillment response of "Hiiiii Unity~~~" from "Default Welcome Intent" in Dialogflow

<table><tr><td>
<img src="docs/images/text-response.png"/ alt="Fulfillment message in Unity via text input">
</td></tr></table>


### Week 5
- Using Audio Source instead of text query
- Creating example!

## Documentation
- Initial documentation including basic intro, proposal and brief process will be updated in README.md, while instructional contents will exist as a [GitHub Page](https://itp-xstory.github.io/uniFlow/).

## Accessibility
All documentation will be done with considerations of the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

## Mentoring
- Nicole He: Dialogflow Mentor
- Igal Nassima: Unity Mentor
